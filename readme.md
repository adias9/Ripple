# Ripple

Ripple is a web application that allows users to message experts in their field of interest in a group format, paralleling the amiable atmosphere of a reception after an event or talk. Based on their LinkedIn endorsements and the quality of their past messages, users will be allowed to join certain group messaging streams or create their own messaging substreams. Ripple ultimately democratizes access to the worldâ€™s experts by providing a platform for people to message each other about professional interests.
